I've recently seen [Fifty Fizzbuzzes](http://vihart.com/fifty-fizzbuzzes/).
The idea is to explore different solutions to the same problem in order to
collect ideas and to learn. I want to do the same for MLPs which handly my
[HASYv2 dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.08380.pdf).


## TODO

* pytorch
* autokeras
