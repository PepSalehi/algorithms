## Purpose

This is copied from `02-keras-validation-curve` where I noticed by looking at
the validation curve that training for 150 epochs did not overfit and not
saturate for the given model.

This time, I train for 1000 epochs instead of 150 epochs.

This change also introduces checkpoints.

## Results

TODO
